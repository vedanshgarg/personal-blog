With OYO’s expansion across multiple geographies, we saw an increase in the number of properties for which we provide search for. With the increase in search-result size, came an uplift in latency. With a P99 of 500ms for our ES, and Hystrix fallback being triggered for 0.1% of the queries… it was time to look into the root cause of these latent queries.

After analyzing logs, it was clear that only those queries were taking time, in which the result size was relatively large.
